# interU

/* Motivation: Choosing universities can be difficult, especially when it is not possible to visit open houses, tours, or uni-run presentations.

Goal: To produce a platform in the post-covid world that would facilitate student access to information about various universities.

Basic Idea: Database search implementing. Search an university by name and all the infos will be available

Future features: Open Source project. Universities will be able to edit their information themselves on standardized platform and post presentation about it. Prospect students will be able to interact with the universities
